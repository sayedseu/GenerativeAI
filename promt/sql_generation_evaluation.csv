```   
This query should give you all of your `products` that are priced above '$100'. It also provides an average price (rounded) per each distinct supplier who supply the products and overall global selling rate for these suppliers. Please note, it is important to be aware about SQL's Window Functions capabilities which can provide more complex scenarios of calculations in rows compared with simple subqueries or joins but this query uses them as an illustrative example how they work: 
```sql   SELECT p.* ,SUM ( s . quantity ) / COUNT(*) OVER () AS average_price, AVG((p. price * SUM (s.quantity))OVER())/COUNT DISTINCT salespeople r ON saleD Id = customer Id FROM customers c JOIN销售（c ，= p ID并列表出所有相关供应商通过连接到主'顾客’的SQL语句。该查询还包括一个WHERE子句以过滤价格高于$100的产品
```   Please adjust the query according to your requirement. This may require more advanced SQL features and might not work in all databases if they do not support Window functions as demonstrated above, or requires a database schema that does not allow such operations (for example MySQL). The given queries are simplified for demonstrating how it works on an abstract level but can still be modified according to your specific requirements.","SELECT p.product_id, p.name, p.price
